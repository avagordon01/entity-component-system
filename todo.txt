could use some utilities for manipulating tuples
    like check A is a subset of B
    get the subset indices of A/B into a bitset
    extract the tuple for a given bitset
    take inspiration from the tuple_element possible implementation

use functors for the systems
how to even have multiple parameter packs
use tuples for the components and systems
want to take in a tuple of all components and a tuple of all systems
maybe each system takes an input tuple, or use some fancy forward_as_tuple
